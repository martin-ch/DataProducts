1 Idea
========================================================
<font size="5"> 

For exploratory data analysis of a dataset it's convenient to
look at the relation of two features and their linear regression.
The presented solution allows to select a dependent and independent variable
of the mtcars dataset.  
A box plot is displayed if the independent variable is a factor variable and
a scatter plot is displayed if the independent variable isn't a factor variable.  

This r-code output shows the structure of the mtcars dataset.
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

2 Usage of interface
========================================================
<font size="5"> 
1/ Dependent Variable: Select the dependent variable of the
mtcars dataset. This variable will be displayed on the y-axis of the resulting
plot and is always a discrete variable (not a factor variable)  
2/ Independent Variable: Select the independent variable of the
mtcars dataset. This variable will be displayed on the x-axis of the resulting
plot and can be either a discrete variable or a factor variable  
3/ The documentation can be selected by clicking on the tab "Documentation" or
adding "/?tab=Documentation" to the url  
4/ The tab "Plot output" shows the plot as well as the coefficients of the linear
model comprised of the independent and dependent variable
